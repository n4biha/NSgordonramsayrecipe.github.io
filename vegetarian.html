                <li>half cup (50g) sugar</li>

            </p>
            <p class="instruct2">Cooking Instructions
                <li>Macerate the Berries: In a medium bowl, lightly mash 1 cup of berries with a potato masher or wooden spoon. Fold in sugar, lemon zest and juice and stir until a syrup begins to form. Fold in remaining 2 cup of berries until everything is well coated, then let sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours.</li>
                <li>Once berries are ready, preheat the broiler to high and move your top oven rack as close to the broiler as possible. Place toast slices on a baking tray and top with slices of brie, letting the edges hang off a bit. Broil for about 30 seconds, keeping a close eye so the cheese doesn't melt too much. Once brie is soft and lightly bubbling, remove from the oven and transfer toasts to plates. </li>
                <li>Top with a smattering of macerated berries and serve immediately, along with plenty of napkins!</li>
